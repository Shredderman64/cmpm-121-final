# Devlog Entry - 11/14/2024

## Introducing the Team
Issac Kim - Engine Lead </br>
Nolan Jensen - Design Lead </br>
Steven Hernandez - Design Lead </br>
Garrett Yu - Tools Lead </br>
Kellum Inglin - Tools Lead </br>

## Tools and Materials
In regards to the engines we plan to use, we chose Unity as our initial engine based off the team's relative familiarity with either one. We then plan to switch over to Godot based on its similarity to Unity.

We intend on using C# as our primary programming language due to its support in both engines we plan on using.

For tools, we plan to use VSCode for our IDE with Git version control.

## Outlook
