# Devlog Entry - 11/14/2024

## Introducing the Team
Issac Kim - Engine Lead </br>
Nolan Jensen - Design Lead </br>
Steven Hernandez - Design Lead </br>
Garrett Yu - Tools Lead </br>
Kellum Inglin - Tools Lead </br>

## Tools and Materials
In regards to the engines we plan on using, we chose Unity as our initial engine based off
the team's relative familiarity with it. We then plan to switch over to Godot based on its
similarity to Unity. It would also be useful to gain experience in both engines as they
represent more commonly used engines for game development.

We intend on using C# as our primary programming language due to its support in both
engines we plan on using as well as being the default language in our first engine.

For tools, we plan on using VSCode for our IDE with Git version control. Again, these were
chosen largely based on team familiarity alongside their ease of integration with our chosen
engines. Furthermore, as we have one team member who has experience in 3D modeling, we intend
to use an appropriate editor for that.

## Outlook

One of the outcomes that we expect from this project is that we'll gain more relevant experience
in regards to building and deploying software from scratch, especially since up to this point,
we've mainly been given the appropriate frameworks to begin with. We anticipate the hardest
parts of this project to be time management and communicating clearly on what each of us is
developing.
