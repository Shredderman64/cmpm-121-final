# Devlog Entry - 11/14/2024

## Introducing the Team
Issac Kim - Engine Lead </br>
Nolan Jensen - Design Lead </br>
Steven Hernandez - Design Lead </br>
Garrett Yu - Tools Lead </br>
Kellum Inglin - Tools Lead </br>

## Tools and Materials
In regards to the engines we plan on using, we chose Unity as our initial engine based off the team's relative familiarity with it. We then plan to switch over to Godot based on its similarity to Unity.
It would also be useful to gain experience in both engines as they represent more commonly used engines for game development.

We intend on using C# as our primary programming language due to its support in both engines we plan on using.

For tools, we plan on using VSCode for our IDE with Git version control. Again, these were chosen largely based on team familiarity alongside their ease of integration with our chosen engines.

## Outlook
